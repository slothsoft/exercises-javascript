A couple of programming exercises I thought would be fun to try.

## New Exercise

It's not perfect yet, but for a new exercise do:

1. Create a new exercise in _src/exercise/<exercise>.js_
1. Create the test in test/exercise/<exercise>-test.js_
1. Create the data (name and HTML mostly) for this exercise in  _src/exercise-data/<exercise>.js_
1. Add an implementation of your exercise to _src/exercise-data.js_
1. Add the copied exercise file as a script to the _index.html_

Or you can use the script `node script/create-new-exercise.js` which does everything but the last step for you. 



## Exercises

- **[Framed Words](https://slothsoft.github.io/exercises-javascript/?exercise=framed-words)** - Write a function that takes a list of strings an prints them, one per line, in a rectangular frame.
- **[Pig Latin](https://slothsoft.github.io/exercises-javascript/?exercise=pig-latin)** - Write function that translates a text to Pig Latin and back.
- **[Spoon Language](https://slothsoft.github.io/exercises-javascript/?exercise=l√∂ffelsprache)** - The spoon language is the German pig latin. The language is based on the exchange of the vowels of a word by fixed abbreviations, whereby the consonants of the word remain untouched.
